The basic idea is to automatically choose the ethx interface and DNS parameters for FEUP's LAN (as it doesn't offer DHCP), if the laptop detects it is on FEUP's network. There are probably built-in ways to do this, hoewever I've started doing this on my own and ended up being a nice 'hands on' tutorial on tools such as awk or sed.
